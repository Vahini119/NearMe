        <h2>Periyachi Amman is a revered Tamil deity, often worshipped as a guardian goddess for pregnant women, children, and families, with her primary worship roots tracing back to the 15th century in Chennai. Known as a protector against evil spirits, her temples, such as those in Singalacherry and other locations, are particularly popular on Tuesdays, Fridays, and during the Tamil month of Aadi, where special rituals for health and fertility are performed.
